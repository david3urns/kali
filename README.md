# kali
A repsitory for Kali related scripts and utilities

My first script, the "kali_setup.sh" script is a simple bash script I wrote to help me get my Kali install setup the way I like it after installation. These are all packages I find helpful, necessary, or cool (i.e. cmatrix, looks neat, but thats about it). 

I've run it a few times with success and am putting it out for other people to try. If you have any suggested packages to add please let me know so that I can update my script!

Any feedback is also appreciated!
